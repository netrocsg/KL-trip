### Website Verification

- ✅ Category filters visible (showing "Cultural & Religious" with 9 activities badge)
- ⚠️ Note: The category badge shows "9" instead of "7" - this may include pre-existing cultural activities

### Files Modified/Added
**Modified Files:**
- `assets/js/activities-data.json` - Updated with 7 new activities
- Multiple image files updated in existing activity folders

**New Files:**
- `add_culture_activities_oct17.py` - Script used to add activities
- `reports/2025-10-17-daily-report.md` - Daily report
- `research_notes_2025-10-17.md` - Research notes
- 12 new image files in new activity folders:
  - `assets/images/activities/batik-painting-workshop/` (3 images)
  - `assets/images/activities/royal-selangor-hard-knocks/` (3 images)
  - Plus updated images in 4 other folders

### Potential Issues Noted
1. **Category Filter Display**: The website shows "Cultural & Religious" category with a badge of "9" activities, but we added 7 new "Culture & Heritage" activities. This suggests:
   - There may be existing cultural/religious activities in the database
   - The category mapping might need verification
   - The JavaScript filtering logic may group multiple category names together

2. **Activities Not Visible**: When clicking the "Cultural & Religious" filter, no activities were displayed in the viewport. This could be due to:
   - JavaScript caching issues
   - Category name mismatch ("Culture & Heritage" vs "Cultural & Religious")
   - Filtering logic needs to be checked

### Recommendations
1. **Verify Category Names**: Check if the website's category filter expects "Cultural & Religious" but we added "Culture & Heritage"
2. **Update Category Mapping**: Ensure consistent category naming between database and frontend
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Users may need to clear cache to see new activities
4. **Test Filtering**: Manually test the category filtering to ensure new activities appear

### Next Steps
1. Check the category naming convention in the codebase
2. If needed, update the 7 new activities to use "Cultural & Religious" instead of "Culture & Heritage"
3. Test the website after cache clears (wait 5-10 minutes)
4. Consider adding cache-busting parameters to JavaScript files
