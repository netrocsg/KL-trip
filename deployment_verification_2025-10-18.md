# Deployment Verification - 2025-10-18

## Verification Time
2025-10-18, approximately 3 minutes after push to GitHub

## Website URL
https://netrocsg.github.io/KL-trip/

## Observations

### Homepage
✅ Website is accessible and loading correctly
✅ Shows "20+ Activities" count
✅ Main navigation working

### Activities Page
⚠️ **Issue Detected**: Shopping & Entertainment category shows (0) activities

**Expected**: Should show 7 shopping activities (IDs 50-56)
**Actual**: Category filter shows "Shopping & Entertainment (0)"

### Possible Causes
1. GitHub Pages may still be building/deploying
2. JavaScript data file may not have updated yet
3. Category name mismatch: Database uses "Shopping & Markets" but website filter shows "Shopping & Entertainment"

### Database Status
✅ Confirmed in repository:
- `assets/activities.json`: 56 activities total
- `assets/js/activities-data.json`: 56 activities total
- Activities IDs 50-56 are Shopping & Markets category
- All photos uploaded and optimized

### Category Name Issue
**Root Cause Identified**: 
- New activities use category: "Shopping & Markets"
- Website filter button shows: "Shopping & Entertainment (0)"
- This is a **category name mismatch**

### Resolution Needed
The website's category filter needs to be updated to match the actual category name in the database, OR the activities need to use the category name expected by the website.

## Recommendation
Check the website's category filtering logic and ensure it matches the category names in the activities database. The shopping activities are in the database but may not be displaying due to category name mismatch.

## Files Successfully Committed
✅ assets/activities.json (updated)
✅ assets/js/activities-data.json (updated)
✅ 21 activity photos (7 activities × 3 photos each)
✅ reports/2025-10-18-daily-report-shopping.md
✅ shopping_activities_data.json
✅ shopping_research_2025-10-18.md

## Next Steps
1. Wait additional time for full GitHub Pages deployment
2. Check category name consistency across the codebase
3. Verify activities appear after category name is corrected
